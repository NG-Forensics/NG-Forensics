Hi, Im Nick.
Technical Investigator|Trust & Safety

I'm a researcher focused on the intersection of digital forensics and platform integrity. I spent a good proportion of my time looking at how scammers and automated systems try to bypass safety controls.

Currently, I'm focusing on the "adversarial" side of things and understanding the infastructure behind account takeovers (ATO) and how to build better detection workflows using network and image data.

Core Technical Interests
- threat modeling: mapping out how bad actors move from account creation to monetization.
- forensics: using tools like wireshark to look at traffic patterns and header mismatches.
- osint and breach intel: using dehashed and ip reputation tools like talos to verify user identity and flag suspicious origins.

Tools & Workflows
- network analysis:wireshark and fiddler 4.
- investigation:pimeyes,yandex,exiftool,dehashed,tineye, etc.
- current goal: finishing my comptia security+ to round out my techincal foundation.
